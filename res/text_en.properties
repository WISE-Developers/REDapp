# fuel type info strings
ui.dlg.title.fuelinfo = FBP Fuel Type Information
ui.label.fuelinfo.previous = Previous
ui.label.fuelinfo.next = Next
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.c1 = This fuel type is characterized by open, park like black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands occupying well-drained uplands in the subarctic zone of western and northern Canada. Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) are minor associates in the overstory. Forest cover occurs as widely spaced individuals and dense clumps. Tree heights vary considerably, but bole branches (live and dead) uniformly extend to the forest floor and layering development is extensive. Accumulation of woody surface fuel is very light and scattered. Shrub cover is exceedingly sparse. The ground surface is fully exposed to the sun and covered by a nearly continuous mat of reindeer lichens (Cladina spp.), averaging 3-4 cm in depth above mineral soil.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.c2 = This fuel type is characterized by pure, moderately well-stocked black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill) B.S.P.) stands on lowland (excluding Sphagnum bogs) and upland sites. Tree crowns extend to or near the ground, and dead branches are typically draped with bearded lichens (Usnea spp.). The flaky nature of the bark on the lower portion of stem boles is pronounced. Low to moderate volumes of downed woody material are present. Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum Oeder) is often the major shrub component. The forest floor is dominated by a carpet of feather mosses and/or ground-dwelling lichens (chiefly Cladonia). Sphagnum mosses may occasionally be present, but they are of little hindrance to surface fire spread. A compacted organic layer commonly exceeds a depth of 20-30 cm.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.c3 = This fuel type is characterized by pure, fully stocked (1000-2000 stems/ha) jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) or lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) stands that have matured at least to the stage of complete crown closure. The base of live crown is well above the ground. Dead surface fuels are light and scattered. Ground cover is feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi) over a moderately deep (approximately 10 cm), compacted organic layer. A sparse conifer understory may be present.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.c4 = This fuel type is characterized by pure, dense jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) or lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) stands (10 000-30 000 stems/ha) in which natural thinning mortality results in a large quantity of standing dead stems and dead downed woody fuel. Vertical and horizontal fuel continuity is characteristic of this fuel type. Surface fuel loadings are greater than in fuel type C-3, and organic layers are shallower and less compact. Ground cover is mainly needle litter suspended within a low shrub layer (Vaccinium spp.).
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.c5 = This fuel type is characterized by mature stands of red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) in various proportions, sometimes with small components of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and old white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) or aspen (Populus spp.). The understory is of moderate density, usually red maple (Acer rubrum L.) or balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). A shrub layer, usually beaked hazelnut (Corylus cornuta Marsh.), may be present in moderate proportions. The ground surface cover is a combination of herbs and pine litter. The organic layer is usually 5-10 cm deep.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.c6 = This fuel type is characterized by pure, fully stocked conifer plantations, with closed crowns and no understory or shrub layer. The forest floor is covered by needle litter with an underlying duff layer up to 10 cm deep. The crown base height is taken into account in predicting fire spread rate and crowning.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.c7 = This fuel type is characterized by uneven-aged stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in various proportions. Western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) may be significant stand components on some sites and at some elevations. Stands are open, with occasional clumpy thickets of multi-aged Douglas-fir and/or larch as a discontinuous understory. Canopy closure is less than 50% overall, although thickets are closed and often dense. Woody surface fuel accumulations are light and scattered. Except within Douglas-fir thickets, the forest floor is dominated by perennial grasses, herbs, and scattered shrubs. Within tree thickets, needle litter is the predominant surface fuel. Duff layers are nonexistent to shallow (<3 cm).
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.d1 = This fuel type is characterized by pure, semimature trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands before bud break in the spring or following leaf fall and curing of the lesser vegetation in the autumn. A conifer understory is noticeably absent, but a well-developed medium to tall shrub layer is typically present. Dead and down roundwood fuels are a minor component of the fuel complex. The principal fire-carrying surface fuel consists chiefly of deciduous leaf litter and cured herbaceous material that are directly exposed to wind and solar radiation. In the spring the duff mantle (F and H horizons) seldom contributes to the available combustion fuel due to its high moisture content.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.d2 = This fuel type is characterized by healthy and pure, semimature trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands during the summer fire season (i.e., following \u201Cgreen-up\u201D or full flushing of the overstory canopy and understory vegetation in late spring or early summer until leaf senescence and drop in the fall). A conifer understory is noticeably absent, but a well-developed medium to tall shrub layer is typically present. Dead and down roundwood fuels are a minor component of the fuel complex. A lush layer of herbaceous plants (i.e., herbs, forbs, and grasses) exists on the ground surface and coupled with the presence of shrubs, the existence of this \u201Cgreen surface fuel effect\u201D with its very high fuel moisture contents serves to dampen surface fire spread potential. The shading from the overstory and understory vegetation markedly reduces solar radiation at the forest floor level. Relative humidity also increases and in-stand wind speed decreases.\n\

ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.m1 = This fuel type (and its green counterpart, M2) is characterized by stand mixtures consisting of the following coniferous and deciduous tree species in varying proportions\: black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), and white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.). On any specific site, individual species can be present or absent from the mixture. In addition to the diversity in species composition, stand mixtures exhibit wide variability in structure and development, but are generally confined to moderately well-drained upland sites. M1, the first phase of seasonal variation in flammability, occurs during the spring and fall. The rate of spread is weighted according to the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of softwood and hardwood components.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.m2 = This fuel type (and its leafless counterpart, M1) is characterized by stand mixtures consisting of the following coniferous and deciduous tree species in varying proportions\: black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), and white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.). On any specific site, individual species can be present or absent from the mixture. In addition to the diversity in species composition, stands exhibit wide variability in structure and development, but are generally confined to moderately well-drained upland sites. M2, the second phase of seasonal variation in flammability, occurs during the summer. The rate of spread is weighted according to the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of softwood and hardwood components. In the summer, when the deciduous overstory and understory are in leaf, fire spread is greatly reduced; with maximum spread rates only one-fifth that of spring or fall fires under similar burning conditions.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.m3 = This fuel type (and its green counterpart, M4) is characterized by mixedwood stands in which balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) grows, often as an understory species, in a heterogeneous mix with spruce (Picea spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), and birch (Betula spp.). These stands are found in the Great Lakes\u2013St. Lawrence and Boreal Forest regions of Canada and are not to be confused with the pure balsam fir stands typical of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Repeated annual defoliation (due to spruce budworm [Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens] attack) causes balsam fir mortality, followed by peeling bark, draped lichen (Spanish moss or old man's beard, Usnea spp.) development, top breakage, and wind throw, peaking 5-8 years after mortality. The volume of downed woody material is initially low but increases substantially with progressive stand decomposition following mortality. The forest floor is a mixture of feather mosses (Pleurozium schreberi spp.), conifer needles, and hardwood leaves. The organic layer is moderately compacted and 8-10 cm deep. After mortality, spring fires in this fuel type behave extremely vigorously, with continuous crowning and downwind spotting.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.m4 = This fuel type (and its leafless counterpart, M3) is characterized by mixedwood stands in which balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) grows, often as an understory species, in a heterogeneous mix with spruce (Picea spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), and birch (Betula spp.). These stands are found in the Great Lakes\u2013St. Lawrence and Boreal Forest regions of Canada and are not to be confused with the pure balsam fir stands typical of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Repeated annual defoliation (due to spruce budworm [Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens] attack) causes balsam fir mortality, followed by peeling bark, draped lichen (Spanish moss or old man's beard, Usnea spp.) development, top breakage, and wind throw, peaking 5-8 years after mortality. The volume of downed woody material is initially low but increases substantially with progressive stand decomposition following mortality. The forest floor is a mixture of feather mosses (Pleurozium schreberi spp.), conifer needles, and hardwood leaves. The organic layer is moderately compacted and 8-10 cm deep. Summer fires are hampered by the proliferation of green understory vegetation resulting from the opening of stand canopy. As sufficient surface fuel accumulates through stand decomposition (usually after 4-5 years), fires will spread through the fuel complex, although not as vigorously as in spring. Forest fire behavior potential is greatest 5-8 years after mortality, decreasing gradually as the surface fuels decompose and the understory vegetation continues to proliferate.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.o1a = This fuel type is characterized by continuous grass cover, with no more than occasional trees or shrub clumps that do not appreciably affect fire behavior. Two subtype designations are available for grasslands; one for the matted grass condition common after snowmelt or in the spring (O1-a) and the other for standing dead grass common in late summer to early fall (O1-b). The proportion of cured or dead material in grasslands has a pronounced effect on fire spread there and must be estimated with care.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.o1ab = This fuel type is characterized by continuous grass cover, with no more than occasional trees or shrub clumps that do not appreciably affect fire behavior. Two subtype designations are available for grasslands; one for the matted grass condition common after snowmelt or in the spring (O1-a) and the other for standing dead grass common in late summer to early fall (O1-b). The proportion of cured or dead material in grasslands has a pronounced effect on fire spread there and must be estimated with care.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.o1b = This fuel type is characterized by continuous grass cover, with no more than occasional trees or shrub clumps that do not appreciably affect fire behavior.

ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.s1 = This fuel type is characterized by slash resulting from tractor or skidder clear-cut logging of mature jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) or lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) stands. The slash is typically one or two seasons old, retaining up to 50% of the foliage, particularly on branches closest to the ground. No post logging treatment has been applied, and slash fuels are continuous. Tops and branches left on site result in moderate fuel loads and depths. Ground cover is continuous feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi) mixed with discontinuous fallen needle litter. Organic layers are moderately deep and fairly compact.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.s2 = This fuel type is characterized by slash resulting from tractor or skidder clear-cut logging of mature to overmature stands of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) or balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Slash is typically one or two seasons old, retaining from 10% to 50% of the foliage on the branches. No post logging treatment has been applied. Fuel continuity may be broken by skid trails unless the site was logged in winter. Tops have been left on site, and most branch fuels have broken off during skidding of logs to landings, which results in moderate fuel loads and depths. Quantities of shattered large and rotten woody fuels may be significant. Ground cover is feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi) with considerable needle litter fallen from the slash. Organic layers are moderately deep and compact.
ui.label.fuelinfo.fuel.s3 = This fuel type is characterized by slash resulting from high-lead clear-cut logging of mature to overmature coastal British Columbia mixed conifer stands. Predominant species are western red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn.), western hemlock (Thuja heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Slash is typically one season old, with the cedar component retaining all its foliage in a cured condition on the branches, whereas the hemlock and Douglas-fir components will have dropped up to 50% of their foliage. Slash fuels tend to be continuous and uncompacted. Very large loadings of broken and rotten unmerchantable material may be present, depending on degree of stand decadence. Slash fuel depths may range from 0.5 to 2.0 m. Ground cover may be feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi) or just compact old needle litter under significant quantities of recent needle litter fallen from the slash. Organic layers are moderately deep to deep and compact. Minor to moderate shrub and herbaceous understory components may be present. This fuel type may also be applied to wet belt cedar-hemlock slash of coastal and interior British Columbia, where the Douglas-fir component is absent.

# Assumptions text
ui.label.assumptions.text = REDapp is an implementation of the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System and Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System. Users of REDapp must be careful to not apply these Systems beyond their useful range.\n\nGeneral FBP System Assumptions\n\nIn the FBP System, predictions are limited to a fire spreading during one burning period from a single point source ignition or line of fire, assuming that:\n\n- Fuel conditions are similar to one of the 16 benchmark fuel types.\n- The fuel moisture codes used are representative of the site conditions.\n- Fuels are uniform and continuous, topography simple and homogeneous, and wind is constant and unidirectional.\n- The fire is wind or wind/slope driven, and spread is not affected by a convective column. Wind is represented by the 10-m open wind.\n- The fire is unaffected by suppression activities (free burning).\n- A fire starting from a point source will have an elliptical shape under the above conditions.\n- The effect of firebrands on spread is accounted for.\n\nThe FBP system will give a good estimate of Fire Intensity Class and Type of Fire in most cases. In most fuel types users should be able to estimate fire size characteristics within ± 20% of computed value for rate of spread > 3 m/min.\n\nGeneral FWI System Assumptions\n\n- The system depends solely on weather readings taken each day at noon local standard time (LST): temperature, relative humidity, 10-m open wind speed, and rain (if any) during the previous 24 hours. The current month must also be specified.\n- Since the FWI System depends only on weather readings and the date (by month), its output can just as easily be calculated from forecast weather to yield a forecast of fire danger.\n- Although the FWI is calculated from noon weather readings, it really represents fire danger at its midafternoon peak, generally specified as 1600 hours LST.\n- The so-called standard fuel type can be described as a generalized pine forest, most nearly the jack pine and lodgepole pine type, which is found in an almost continuous band across Canada. This concept fits the nature of the field data that form the foundation for the FWI.\n- The question of how fire behavior varies with fuel type was judged to be a separate problem, to be tackled in other ways. The FWI System does not account for green-up. Different fuel types can exhibit different fire behavior despite having the same FWI System values.
